ISBN-13:9780136060482
Authors: Jeffrey Waybright, Robert Kemp

Once students see that accounting is the language of business, they are well on their way to academic and professional success. Financial Accounting translates the essentials of accounting to students so they understand why and when financially sound decisions are made in business today. The new Canadian adaptation of Kemp’s Financial Accounting has a very clear goal: provide as much coverage of financial statement preparation and essential concepts as a non-accounting student needs to know in a way that helps these students relate to the content and learn. This product aims to tackle challenging topics in a pragmatic, straightforward manner so that students understand concepts in accounting and its critical role in the business world. Its focus on smaller businesses allows students to better navigate the numbers with more practical examples of what they may encounter in the real world.
